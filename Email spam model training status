Current Training Approach: Using model.fit(X_train_features, Y_train)

What I'm Training On:
X_train_features: Numerical features extracted from training text data
Y_train: Correct labels (spam/not spam) for the training examples

Current Challenge:
I don't know how to train the model on other parameters or different data
Still learning how to modify what features the model uses
Need to understand how to experiment with different input variables

Primary Goal:
I wanted something that worked first, then learn to customize it
Got basic spam classifier running, now need to understand how to modify training inputs
Focus was on getting through the complete workflow rather than optimizing features

Next Steps Needed:
Learn how to change what features go into X_train_features
Understand how to experiment with different training data
Practice modifying the feature extraction process

Status: Have working model but limited understanding of how to customize the training process beyond basic implementation.
Learning Priority: Understanding how to control what the model learns from, not just that it works.
