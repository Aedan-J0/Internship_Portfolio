# LLM Hallucination Detection Project

## What This Project Is About
I'm building a system that can tell when AI chatbots are making stuff up, which is called "hallucinating." Basically, every time an AI gives you an answer, my model will give it a confidence score that tells you how trustworthy that answer probably is. It's like having a fact checker that runs automatically in the background.

## The Goals
I need to create a model that looks at what an AI wrote and figures out if it's reliable. It should give each answer a score from 0 to 100, with criteria in between, where higher scores mean the answer is probably more trustworthy. The tricky part is making it work fast enough that people can actually use it in real time, and making sure it actually helps users know when they should double check an AI's answer.
The end goal is that whenever someone asks a chatbot a question, they don't just get the answer but also get a little confidence meter that tells them how much they should trust it. If the confidence is low, they know to maybe look it up somewhere else or ask for sources.

## The Game Plan
Working with the data is going to be a huge part of this project. I need to clean up all the messy or broken data I collect, fill in gaps where information is missing, and make sure everything is in the same format so my model can actually understand it. I also have to check that the data quality is good because if I train on garbage data, I'll get a garbage model.
Building the actual model is where things get really interesting. I'm planning to try different approaches and see which ones work best for detecting hallucinations. Some might be better at catching factual errors, while others might be better at spotting when an AI is just making up plausible sounding nonsense. I'll need to train each model using my data, then spend a lot of time tweaking settings and parameters until it performs really well. Testing is crucial too because I need to know how accurate it actually is in real world situations.
Once I have a working model, I want to create really good visualizations that show how well it works. This means making performance charts, comparison graphs between different approaches, and doing error analysis to figure out what kinds of mistakes my model makes. I think having clear, easy to read summaries will be important so people can understand what I built and whether it's actually useful.
Documentation is probably the most boring part, but it's really important. I need to write down how I built everything and what I learned along the way. I want to keep a development journal of all the decisions I made and why I made them, because I know I'll forget otherwise. I also need to write up how well my model actually works and create user guidelines so other people can use what I made.

## The Final Product
I'm aiming for something that can process answers in under a second because nobody wants to wait around for a confidence score. It should be able to handle lots of users at once without crashing, and it needs to work with different types of AI chatbots, not just one specific system.
Most importantly, I want users to be able to understand why the model gave a certain confidence score. If it says an answer has low confidence, people should be able to see what made it suspicious. Maybe the AI cited a source that doesn't exist, or maybe it made a claim that contradicts well known facts.
