# LLM Hallucination Detection
What This Project Is About

This is an exploratory project I’m working on during my internship. The idea is to build a system that can flag when an AI model is “hallucinating” — in other words, when it produces answers that sound confident but aren’t accurate. Right now, I’m only developing and testing it locally on my computer. It’s not a finished application or meant for consumer use yet — just a proof-of-concept.

## Goals

My goal is to experiment with different approaches to see if I can score AI responses based on their reliability. The scoring system would ideally range from 0 to 100, where higher numbers mean more trustworthy answers. Since this is still early, I’m mainly focused on:

* Cleaning and preparing data to train on

* Trying different modeling techniques to see what works best

* Measuring accuracy and figuring out common error patterns

* Documenting what I learn along the way

## Plan

The bulk of the work right now is around data handling and model experimentation. I’m:

* Cleaning and formatting training data so it’s usable

* Testing different models to detect hallucinations (factual errors, misleading statements, etc.)

* Comparing their performance and doing error analysis

* Building simple visualizations (charts, graphs) to make results easy to understand

This is still local and experimental, so I’m not worrying about things like real-time latency or scaling to lots of users. Instead, my focus is just on building something that works reasonably well and shows whether the idea has potential.
